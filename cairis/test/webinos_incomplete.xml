  <background>Increasingly, users are owning more connected devices and expecting applications to keep preferences and status information synchronised across devices in different domains. The purpose of the webinos project is to define and deliver an open source platform, which will enable web applications and services to be used and shared consistently and securely over a broad spectrum of connected devices. To achieve this, it defines and provides an architecture and infrastructure to allow applications to run not only on a single device, but also across devices and domains. This applies to device features as well. New APIs are also provided to allow access to local and remote device resources and network resources in the Cloud.

webinos is a cross-domain platform for secure web application delivery. These domains include mobile, PCs, home media (TVs), and in-car units devices. It is specified as middleware installed on a selection of operating systems (OSs) on current devices to enable the consistent and secure web application user experience. At the time of writing the supported OSs and device platforms include:
Android 2.3.x
tested with devices: Nexus S, Asus Transformer Prime, Samsung Galaxy S2, Sonyericsson Xperia Arc, Galaxy Note
Microsoft Windows 7 SP, Windows 7, Windows XP
tested with laptops: Vaio z11, Dell, Asus EeePC (1215N)
Linux: Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Slackware 13.1, 13.37, Mint, Fedora
tested with devices: VMWare Player, Samsung, Asus EeePC (1215N)
TV variants of Cocom Churchill 177, Acer Revo etc.
vehicle variant of Pandaboard Rev. A3 with Ubuntu 11.10
Mac OS X
The webinos platform includes not only a set of newly defined APIs to enhance current web application runtime environments, but also an overlay network architecture to enable the webinos specific features.
</background>
  <strategic_goals>Promoting a “single service for every device” vision, webinos will move the existing baseline of web development from installed applications to services, running consistently across a wide range of connected devices, ensuring that the technologies for describing, negotiating, securing, utilizing device functionalities and adapting to context are fit for purpose.

Innovations in contextual description will be broad covering but not limited to device capabilities, network access, user identity and preferences, location, behaviourally induced properties and finally the more complex issue of the users’ social network context and social media engagement.

webinos will boost the industry migration towards web-based services. webinos can back this by providing inter-operable, standardised, open source technology utilizable across domains with direct commercially exploitable value. webinos will also act as an industry catalyst to encourage collaboration and discourage fragmentation in this space. There are strong industry moves towards Internet friendly and Internet integrated offerings, and there exists a window of opportunity to place the webinos technology on a robust open foundation that will remove economic barriers to engagement, embody policy on data privacy in concrete technology and creating a centre of web centric expertise.</strategic_goals>

  <naming_conventions>
    <entry name="Application installation" >
      <definition>Installation (or setup) of a program (including drivers, plugins, etc.) is the act of putting the program onto a computer system so that it can be executed. Because the requisite process varies for each program and each computer, many programs (including operating systems) come with a general-purpose or dedicated installer – a specialized program which automates most of the work required for their installation.</definition>
    </entry>
    <entry name="Application lifecycle" >
      <definition>A continuous process of managing the life of an application through governance, development and maintenance.</definition>
    </entry>
    <entry name="Application Programming Interface (API)" >
      <definition>An interface, i.e. a point of interaction between components, implemented by a software program that enables it to interact with other software. It facilitates interaction between different software programs similar to the way the user interface facilitates interaction between humans and computers.</definition>
    </entry>
    <entry name="Applications" >
      <definition>A complete, self-contained program that performs a specific function directly for the user. This is in contrast to system software such as the operating system kernel, server processes, libraries which exists to support application programs and utility programs. </definition>
    </entry>
    <entry name="Authentication" >
      <definition>Authentication is the process of confirming the correctness of the claimed identity.</definition>
    </entry>
    <entry name="Certificate Authority (CA)" >
      <definition>(i) A trusted third party 'clearing house' that issues digital signatures and digital certificates [ISO/IEC 27002:2005].  (ii) An infrastructure that issues certificates signed by or chained to a root certificate owned by the organization operating the CA infrastructure. CA-operating organizations typically own multiple root certificates, and apply various certification practices, e.g. level of business or domain validation required for issuing certificates signed by a particular root certificate. [Source: WAC]</definition>
    </entry>
    <entry name="Child application" >
      <definition>A child application is a self contained application package that is included within another application package (parent application). The are used as means for distributed application development and deployment where a parent application can export child applications to other devices in order to provide a service that can be distributed over several devices to the user.</definition>
    </entry>
    <entry name="Cloud" >
      <definition>Cloud computing is Web-based processing, whereby shared resources, software, and information are provided to computers and other devices (such as smartphones) on demand over the Internet.
The Cloud can therefore refer to a range of services provided by remote infrastructures. A single instance of a Cloud is Amazon EC2, for example.</definition>
    </entry>
    <entry name="Content adaptation" >
      <definition>Is the action of transforming content to adapt to device capabilities. Content adaptation is usually related to mobile devices that require special handling because of their limited computational power, small screen size and constrained keyboard functionality.</definition>
    </entry>
    <entry name="Context" >
      <definition>Schilit et al. (1994) define context as where you are, who you are with, and what resources are nearby. This might suggest that context is more focused on the user’s surrounding as opposed to his/her inner states. A more specific definition is provided by Dey et al(2001). They defined it as any information that can be used to characterize the situation of an entity. An entity is a person, place, or object that is considered relevant to the interaction between a user and an application, including the user and applications themselves. Some examples of context types according to the actor/entity that is involved are: User context (contexts describing a user’s situation), software context (context describing a software’s situation).
Context is more or less the set of facts or circumstances that surround a situation or event.</definition>
    </entry>
    <entry name="Credential" >
      <definition>Data that is transferred or presented to establish either a claimed identity or the authorizations of a system entity. [RFC 2828]</definition>
    </entry>
    <entry name="Cross-Device Application" >
      <definition>A webinos application capable of running on multiple devices, such as a set-top box and smartphone, not necessarily simultaneously.</definition>

    <entry name="Digital Certificate" >
      <definition>A structure that associates an identity with an entity such as a user, a product or an Application Instance where the certificate has an associated asymmetric key pair which can be used to authenticate that the entity does, indeed, possess the Private Key. [IEC 62541-2, ed. 1.0 (2010-02)]</definition>
    </entry>
    <entry name="Digital Signature" >
      <definition>The result of a cryptographic transformation of data which, when properly implemented, provides the services of: (i) origin authentication, (ii) data integrity, (iii) signer non-repudiation. [FIPS 140-2]</definition>
    </entry>
    <entry name="Event" >
      <definition>A set of structured data that is meant to be exchanged among two or more addressable entities (e.g., applications, services).</definition>
    </entry>
    <entry name="Feature" >
      <definition>An option or functional capability available to the user.</definition>
    </entry>
    <entry name="Node" >
      <definition>Most commonly, 'Node' or 'nodejs' is used to refer to the NodeJS software which is used by webinos as a programming language and framework. From the website (NODE): "Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices."</definition>
    </entry>
    <entry name="Personal Zone" >
      <definition>This provides the means for users to manage their personal devices and services. The zone is exposed on each device as a set of local APIs, with a shared model of context that is synchronized across all devices in the zone together with the personal zone hub. The personal zone supports a single sign on mechanism so that users authenticate to a device, the device to the zone, and the zone to applications/services. The zone further supports an overlay networking model that hides the details of addressing and interconnect technologies. This is based upon 3rd party components that enable the zone to scale in the face on a continuing evolution of networking technologies. Note that some devices (e.g. a TV or networked printer) may be shared by several people, and forms part of a shared zone.</definition>
    </entry>
    <entry name="Platform" >
      <definition>An operating system and software environment running on top of a device, managing the device hardware and providing common services for efficient execution of various application software.

Examples: The most common operating systems used in mobile smart phones include Symbian OS, Android, iOS, RIM Black Berry OS, or Windows Mobile. Popular modern operating systems for personal computers include Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and GNU/Linux. MeeGo is a Linux-based open source mobile operating system project, primarily targeted at mobile devices and information appliances in the consumer electronics market.</definition>
    </entry>
    <entry name="Service" >
      <definition>An addressable logical functional entity that is exposed on a device or a server. The service availability varies over time depending on the device status (on/off), service status (stopped/running/installed/uninstalled) and connection status (connected/disconnected). Examples of services are: an API to get the temperature from a sensor, a web API provided by a Web Server or a remote control API provided by a TV.</definition>
    </entry>
    <entry name="WAC" >
      <definition>The Wholesale Applications Community (WAC) is an open global alliance formed from the world’s leading telecoms operators. It has been established to increase the overall market for mobile applications. It strives to unite a fragmented applications marketplace by providing common developer tools, a revenue share model across the entire ecosystem and common network and terminal APIs.</definition>
    </entry>
    <entry name="Widget" >
      <definition>An interactive application for displaying and/or updating local data or data on the Web, packaged in a way to allow a single download and installation on a user's machine or mobile device. [WAC]</definition>
    </entry>
    <entry name="Widget Renderer" >
      <definition>Widget Renderers are the GUI element on each device capable of displaying a widget. We differentiate a renderer from a processor as the renderer only shows the widget and supports user interaction, whereas the processor unpacks the widget and manages installation. A widget renderer may be a stand-alone application, such as a browser, or may be a webinos-defined component. It is up to the implementation to actually differentiate between these concepts.</definition>

<persona name="Alice" type="Primary" assumption_persona="TRUE" image="/home/cairisuser/cairis/cairis/images/alice.jpg" >
  <activities>TV rocks Alice's world. Alice loves watching national and international TV, and, after work each day, enjoys nothing more than browsing some of the more esoteric TV channels from around the world, from Japanese Sci-Fi to Angus Buchan sermons in South Africa.

At home, her TV home entertainment system takes central stage in her social life, to the extent that her primary means of web-surfing and viewing photographs is the TV.

Alice is part of an online community of fellow TV addicts. She provides online services with details of her preferences, and allows services to keep track of her viewing habits. She is rewarded with suggestions about programmes of interest to her. Specifically, the selection available is based on her viewing history and the interests of others with similar viewing characteristics.</activities>
  <attitudes>To feed her TV addiction, Alice has built her own home-entertainment system. The system is an elaborate pipeline of different components, with eclectic input sources such as satellite dishes and PCs streaming programme information, and output devices such as speakers and, of course, her TV.

Her interests have made her technically adept enough to examine the specification of devices she might want to purchase to ensure they meet her quality of service expectations, and are compatible with her "cloud" of devices.</attitudes>

  <motivations>Alice likes to spend as much quality time as possible watching the TV, and has optimised the hardware in her lounge around this goal. When Alice wants to change channel, she will reach for whichever device is closest to her; this is invariably her smart phone, although she recently repurposed an old handset to see if she could use this as a remote as well! If Alice needs to use the web or chat online, she will re-purpose her desktop's wireless keyboard and use the TV has her monitor. To facilitate this, Alice makes sure her TV and peripheral devices are modern enough to be discoverable by her controlling applications.</motivations>
  <skills>Alice is comfortable configuring Audio-Visual equipment. This includes transcoding media from one format to another, configuring software for streaming over her home LAN, and setting up TV and satellite feeds into her home entertainment system.</skills>

</persona>
<persona name="Anna" type="Primary" assumption_persona="TRUE" image="/home/cairisuser/cairis/cairis/images/anna.jpg" >
  <activities>Anna is in the final year of an undergraduate medical degree. Breathing difficulties, coupled with a very mild form of Cerebral Palsy mean that some of her motor skills are limited and she is prone to bouts of fatigue. Because of her restricted mobility, Anna is dependent on the use of a wheel-chair.

Despite her disability, Anna is keen on socialising, and lives in an adapted halls of residence at her university, so she can get out and meet people.</activities>
  <attitudes>Although Anna had problems studying with her disabilities in school, her expectations about the accessibility of places, processes, and things have been raised during her time at university. These were raised in line with her desire to be more independent. Her local authority provides her access to a Personal Assistant when she occasionally needs help with shopping or other physically demanding activities, and she finds that many shops and places around university are becoming more accessible. As a result, Anna expects software and systems to be accessible enough for her to use.

As the world around her has become more accessible, Anna has grown to dislike being type-casted because she relies on a wheel-chair. When she can, as much for exercise as anything else, she will try to walk short distances without a wheel-chair. Moreover, as her graduation approaches, she has become increasingly wary of highlighting her disability too greatly. With the current economic crisis, Anna is concerned she might miss out on jobs if her CV or an application form suggests she might be too much of a burden.</attitudes>
  <aptitudes>Anna's desire for independence has given her a sharp eye for identifying ways that technology can improve her mobility. To reduce her reliance on her Personal Assistant constantly visiting her, she uses her mobile to keep in touch with her if she needs something. She also uses an electric wheelchair to get around, and is on the look out for any technology which might improve her studies and way of life, even if she has to pay for it herself because her local authority will not.

Anna realises, however, that she does not live in a perfect world and needs to forward plan if she does anything which she thinks might be out of the ordinary. If Anna needs to take a bus, she tries to find out if she can take a wheel-chair on it before she ventures out. Anna also tries to find out if new shops are accessible before she first visits them, especially when buying clothes; she does not want to find something she likes only to discover that there is nowhere accessible to try it on.</aptitudes>
  <motivations>Being disabled, Anna often needs to deal with a lot of bureaucracy to get the care she needs, and would love for some of this to be automated. She is convinced that technology can help her reduce the amount of forms she invariably needs to complete to get her benefits, or the number of people she has to deal with in local government or her university to resolve issues which occasionally crop up.

Despite her self confidence, Anna always needs to think about what happens when things go wrong. Getting wheel-chair problems when out and about can leave her stranded because she struggles when walking more than a short distance.</motivations>

<persona name="Clara" type="Primary" assumption_persona="TRUE" image="/home/cairisuser/cairis/cairis/images/clara.jpg" >
  <activities>Clara is a teenager who lives with her family. Clara has diabetes and in order to live a good life, she actively manages her diabetes by herself. For this purpose, she uses modern technology, such as a laptop and a smartphone. Together with her blood glucose meter she collects and stores the measured data on a cloud service which is accessible by her physician.</activities>
  <attitudes>Like most of the teenagers of her age, Clara wants to enjoy her life and have fun. She goes out with friends, eats unhealthy things and has an irregular daily routine. Being distracted by all the interesting things around her, she often forgets to measure her blood glucose level. As a result, her glucose level is too high on average. This is dangerous to her health. Even though her physician emphasises the importance of a good glucose level and the risks of a high glucose level, she is not caring enough. In fact, Clara is willing to manage her disease but she also does not want to give up the fun part of her life. Currently, she tends more to the fun part than to healthcare. She did not find her balance yet, but she is in the process of learning to cope with her disease.</attitudes>

<persona name="David" type="Primary" assumption_persona="TRUE" image="/home/cairisuser/cairis/cairis/images/david.jpg" >
  <activities>From early age, David has been involved in a number of challenging (legal and illegal) activities. However, his minor sporting successes have not brought a very comfortable or profitable life. He has spent a significant part of his life as a young adult in jail.

His actual work as skilled car mechanics has positive facets: raised in a household of mechanics and car experts, he finds the work easy, and he can effortlessly achieve very good results in repairing cars. However, his troubled nature prevents him from being satisfied and he is unable to foresee a bright career.</activities>
  <attitudes>David was raised in family where talking about cars was the norm. His parents allowed his love of racing vehicles to bloom.

Another parental (David's father's, in particular) gift was the negative influence (build up on the father's disciplinary extremes) that cursed him with a youth of disorder and an unbalanced personality. This resulted in an inclination to commit crimes, break laws and rules, and be violent.

Some sporting achievements have made him fairly popular, but have had the unfortunate side-effect of encouraging his illegal activities: his self-confidence increased as well as his attraction to hazardous activities.

Due to his careless attitude and lack of consideration for consequences, he can perform actions that have potentially dreadful impact on others and possibly also to himself.</attitudes>
  <aptitudes>His upbringing gifted him with a good competence in the working and internals of cars as he was involved in daily car trouble-shooting and discussion. This love for talking about cars and problem-solving led him to open and maintain a blog where car problems are dissected. Often, David give good advice and pretty good solutions to a problem in comprehensible and effective manner, due to his disposition to break up problems into simpler terms.</aptitudes>
  <motivations>David loves to be fast, he feels all life should be passed at increasing speed. In this sense, a growing feeling of non-satisfaction is growing within him. David's present work is boring, his pockets are empty (difficult to have any savings if you come and go from prison). Furthermore, he recently lost a chance of a career move.

A way to possibly collect some money more is tampering. Clever tampering! "Selective" tampering! Meaning a kind of damage that causes vehicles to develop a problem after some time, possibly in different parts. This means that he will be asked to fix a number of problems that happen at the same time, resulting in more work and even some well-paid overtime.</motivations>
  <skills>Apart car aptitudes, David also has some IT skills.
David is quite familiar with company's communication system and with vulnerability exploitation.</skills>

<persona name="Eric" type="Primary" assumption_persona="FALSE" image="/home/cairisuser/cairis/cairis/images/eric.jpg" >
  <activities>Eric is Helen's 5 year old son.  Although not a webinos user as such, he does use sometimes use his mother's webinos-enabled tablet device when going on journeys.  Although Helen usually thinks about what Eric might do for long journeys, he is usually left to his own devices on short-duration trips like school-runs or shopping trips.</activities>
  <attitudes>Eric enjoys activities which draw the attention of others, and likes to involve other people in the games that he plays.  For this reason, Eric is particularly fond of playing simple games with his parents, such as I Spy.</attitudes>
  <aptitudes>As Eric has grown older, he has also developed an interest in activities which absorb his interest.  Card and memory games have been known to keep Eric distracted on long journeys.  Similarly, Eric is happy to watch films and take a snooze when feels a little tired.</aptitudes>
  <motivations>Eric focuses his energies on whatever technology he has to hand, but always looks for instant gratification based on his current needs.  Although he finds tables and touch-screens intriguing, he is prone to throwing down objects he doesn't like.  Eric will tolerate things he doesn't find immediately useful only if he expects a reward as a consequence of using it.
If Eric is going on long journeys, he takes comfort in his things which are familiar to him.  For example, Helen often gives Eric his teddy bear when travelling long distances, such as to a theme park or trips to his grandparents, and is usually unable to sleep on car journeys without this.  Although Eric doesn't hold his teddy bear all the time, he becomes distressed if unable to reach for this at any time from his seat.</motivations>

<persona name="Ethan" type="Primary" assumption_persona="TRUE" image="/home/cairisuser/cairis/cairis/images/ethan.png" >
  <activities>Ethan is a student just like many others: he has no particular problems or outstanding successes. Unlike many others, he believes that taking some shortcuts (of dubious legality) can be of some help. In order to gain some extra spending-money and fill his always-empty student pockets, he devotes part of his time to earning money illegally as a spammer. One of his activities, for example, is sending messages on behalf of individuals who sell counterfeit good, or participating in an email campaign for a "pump and dump" scheme.</activities>
  <attitudes>Much like many other students, Ethan does not have a strong inclination toward rules and laws. In fact, he has a quite pronounced inclination toward illicit activities that can be more or less remunerative. However, he still doesn't want to get in trouble with the law, he is just willing to risk it because he wants money even more.</attitudes>
  <aptitudes>Ethan has cultivated some of the essential skills for his fraudulent network activities. His habitual tasks consist in looking for vulnerable networks, exploiting such vulnerabilities and then gathering data from those non security-savvy systems. Whenever possible and whenever he thinks it is not too risky, he enjoys accessing and taking control of vulnerable systems and harvesting data from vulnerable targets. When successful, this often includes usernames, passwords, and also details of credit cards that have been illicitly gained by other malicious intruders. This information can be profitably used for trading of credit card number (good offers for them in Black Market) and for circumvent monitoring system and anti-spam filters.</aptitudes>
  <motivations>He wants easy money, since in his opinion it is very rarely the most tiresome way that is the best one. During his student career, he has found it difficult to make much money in legal ways. Since he already has a botnet at his service, why not use it for some additional source of wealth? Being a botnet administrator has many other benefits. For example, he can attack politicians with whom he disagrees. After all, Ethan has some sense of civic responsibility in his own way.</motivations>
  <skills>Ethan most important skills lies in the administrator-level knowledge of a botnet, and on the knowledge of how exploit it for illicit spamming activities and other illicit activities using them. For these reasons, knowledge of using spamming tools is of benefit to his business.</skills>

  <activities>Frankie is an alienated computer addict. He started using computer at the age of six, when he was troubled by the separation of his parents, and all his life has been centered on computers ever since. Up to now, he has had a quite normal student career, without any notable brilliance or related achievements.</activities>
  <attitudes>He never established strong friendships and can only express himself through computers. Since computers have been his main friends, he has failed to pick up some society norms and values, including commonly known laws and rules.

The parent's separation gave him an inner sense of rage and frustration, making him quarrelsome and vexatious. Sadly, he is just looking for attention and support, but he's not able to express this to anyone in person.

His present hobbys involve malicious computer actions, however, his knowledge of security is naive, and he can only us publicly-available tools for exploiting systems. He is constantly seeking attention and recognition and usually brags about his stunts on internet. This gains him only disregard from his victims and scorn from real security experts.</attitudes>
  <aptitudes>The very early emotional trauma he suffered deprived him of his motivation to learn. He just wants attention, but no one has taught him the right way to get self-esteem. So, he learns to take the easy option and the "fast way" toward his goals, not understanding the fruitfulness of the longer ones. He is involved in a number of licit or illicit tasks (Wi-F cracking, virus spreading) but he has no more than a superficial knowledge and interest in any of them.</aptitudes>
  <motivations>He wants to damage others and gain money in order to attract attention, and achieve a fake sense of control in a otherwise unhappy and unimportant life.</motivations>
  <skills>He has an understanding of computers and Internet, but due to his lack of motivation for education and learning, his knowledge is only a little above average, especially regarding public (or almost public) domain software used to hack networks.</skills>

<persona name="Helen" type="Primary" assumption_persona="TRUE" image="/home/cairisuser/cairis/cairis/images/helen.jpg" >
  <activities>Helen is a 32 year old marketing manager for a publishing house in Brighton.

Helen has a 3 year old toddler, Eric, which she drops off at the nursery on the way to work each morning, and picks up at a fixed time on her way home. This is something Helen has to do because Scott, her husband, works in the City, so catches a train to and from work.</activities>
  <attitudes>Helen feels strongly about her role as a mother of a young family. Even though her job can be quite stressful and demanding time-wise, she feels it's important to maintain a healthy work-life balance. For this reason, she works regular office hours (partly to make sure she can drop off her child to/from the nursery, works with work media at the office only and, unlike most of her friends, LinkedIn is the only social network she uses at work.

The only time Helen transfers media between devices is when she is in the office and doing things like tranferring presentations and documents between PCs and laptops. Helen does, however, use the cloud to store snaps that she has taken of her family.</attitudes>
  <aptitudes>Although Helen wouldn't call herself technically literate, she has become quite adept at using the technology around her to streamline her working life. She uses a blue-tooth hands-free phone in her car, and makes sure the calendar on her phone (with both work and home calendar) is kept synchronised with her work laptop, PC, and the home media system her husband has setup.</aptitudes>
  <motivations>Helen works hard to make sure her day-to-day life is as predictable as possible. Because of this, Helen wants to rely on the context-awareness features in her applications. She wants her data to be synchronised when it needs to be, and to be prompted when she (invariably) forgets things.</motivations>
  <skills>None</skills>
  <intrinsic>Helen's concern about her family can sometimes cloud her judgement or lead her to make access control decisions that, in the cold light of day, might not be best for her or Eric.  On a good day, however, Helen has an eye for seeing intricacies in contexts, and appreciating the sort of things that strangers might want to take advantage of.</intrinsic>
  <contextual>Thinking explicitly about how her family interacts with technology helps Helen think about how to access control data associated with these interactions.  Also, because little details that complicate thinking, Helen uses things like sketches and abstractions to support the access control decision making process.</contextual>

<persona name="Jessica" type="Primary" assumption_persona="TRUE" image="/home/cairisuser/cairis/cairis/images/jessica.jpg" >
  <activities>Jessica lives and works in California. She is in charge of developing a mobile application for diabetes, and a business co-founder. The diabetes application is being written for iPhone and Android platforms. The diabetes application is easy to use. Many diabetes people who are not computer-addicted are using it. It enables the planning, monitoring, and follow-up of diabetes patients via smart-phones. The application captures blood sugar and insulin measurements, and reminds the patient about when to do the measurements. All personal and medical data is also relayed and stored securely in an online application server, with a back office for diabetes research professionals. There is also a patented diet calculator included in the mobile application. The application was the winner of the "Apps for Medicare" competition at the White House, in Washington, DC, in 2010, because it has been embraced by the Diabetes community, General Practitioners, and Insurance Companies. She has based the data models on the HL7-standard as much as possible. A stringent and flexible privacy policy, in which the individual diabetes patient is in full control of who can access and use the data, has been a requirement for the patients to trust the system. In the picture above she is in the medicare technology conference where she received the "Apps for Medicare" award.

She is a traditional application developer that develops software clients for two smart-phone platforms. She keeps herself up-to-date on new technologies, applies them when writing new software and she knows what the competitors are doing. She is a diligent person, and carefully implements and tests the applications and she wants to understand the technologies before applying them. As a member of HL7, she is also a privacy-aware developer. She is very committed, systematic, and organised. She helps people make informed choices about their health. She likes to structure information and data, elicit requirements, and to delegate some tasks to the user and other tasks to the system. She communicates with a variety of people working with diabetes treatment, care, and research. She is a user-conscious developer, involving users as participants in her work, and she also has a user forum. Although she is user-centred she has a preference to mix it with model-driven development techniques, too. She models tasks and domain objects. She also models the context of use - as means to understand the users' everyday activities surrounding their diabetes problem.</activities>
  <attitudes>Creating trust, keeping her promises, and maintaining integrity are key values for Jessica. Being able to help other people means a lot for her. After her graduation she worked three years as engineer for United Nations and Save the Children in Africa to help governments and people. When she came back to the US, she realised she wanted to continue helping people with their health problems. She contacted some other like-minded through the university alumni, co-founded the company, got venture capital onboard in the round A funding, and further institutional investors from the health insurance sector onboard in round B. Integrity and customer-intimacy are key values for Jessica, and this is why the investors have been backing in her. She is very likeable and social one-on-one, but quite private and shy in larger crowds.

Although technically strong, she dislikes HTML and web development. Jessica feels that making more of the system open on the web implies much less control over the UI. She also believes the system becomes more open to attackers in general so her system must be very secure, have 100% uptime, and adhere to the best privacy policies. She also needs full control over every pixel on the screen, and the connection to the insulin meter.</attitudes>
  <aptitudes>Jessica isn't athletic, but she is naturally talented at maths. She uses her maths skills to draw 2D and 3D graphics and curves in ways that some of her colleagues are unable to grasp. She enjoys integrating with low-level sensors, visualising medical data as 3D-charts, and in encoding and decoding data. Her natural talent for plotting such data on the screen, are one of the reasons to the product success.</aptitudes>
  <motivations>She is highly motivated by the desire to engage and interact with patients, relatives, and healthcare professionals. As a result, she goes to great lengths to ensure her customers are happy. It inspires her to be able to spend many consecutive hours per day in front of her laptops to improve the applications using Eclipse and XCode. She becomes even more committed, the closer she gets to a user forum meeting.

Jessica burns to deliver the perfect, robust product. She frequently tests the applications. Being able to help each individual certainly boosts her energy level. Progress and improvement makes her happy, while misery and deterioration makes her anxious and less effective.

Jessica considers reduced quality of data as a direct threat to their business. Errors and loss of data over time could lead to a court case, or media coverage, which could bring the entire company to the brink. Storing the same data at multiple locations is a solution for them. Privacy is important.</motivations>
  <skills>Jessica is a specialist in Objective C and Java programming. She writes Objective C code in XCode for the iPhone app, and Java for Dalvik on Android. Jessica is also familiar with information visualisation and UI widget libraries associated with iPhone and Android platforms.

Jessica is adept at working with many hand-sets, but is unfamiliar with Nokia and Sony Ericsson hand-set development because she has never had need to do this.</skills>

<persona name="Jimmy" type="Primary" assumption_persona="TRUE" image="/home/cairisuser/cairis/cairis/images/jimmy.jpg" >
  <activities>Jimmy's life is software development and Internet services. He is a self-employed professional software developer for mobile applications but he also spends his leisure time on writing plug-ins for his home equipment.

Jimmy is a passionate and experienced professional software developer. His focus is on mobile applications and Web applications. His experience covers the iPhone, Android and further technologies. He writes new applications and ports them to different platforms. He does software development for quite some years. Apart from that, he is a passionate and successful blogger.</activities>
  <attitudes>When developing software, Jimmy prefers open source. For him it is important to control what is going on in the software he uses. He chooses his tool chain and makes architectural decisions for his software accordingly. He keeps all the source code he once wrote and reuses fragments of it in other projects whenever it makes sense. For him, his source code is his own treasury of valuables he has created in his life. He always wants to have access to it and reuse whenever useful. He has no notion of braking the law by this behaviour. He just wants to implement good and working applications without reimplementing things he already implemented.</attitudes>
  <aptitudes>Jimmy follows a pragmatic hands-on design and implementation approach. He is much more into trying out things rather than spending time on theory. As he is interested in new technologies and new market opportunities he always stays up-to-date in his field. Jimmy enjoys experimenting with new technology and he adapts quickly. He learns best by just trying out things. Apart from that, he knows how to make money from the applications he writes, as he sells some mobile applications on an application store.</aptitudes>
  <motivations>Jimmy is font of software-controlled gadgets which interact with other devices on his home network. He makes use of his professional knowledge to implement plug-ins and extensions for his home equipment. This allows him to let all the devices do what he needs.</motivations>
  <skills>Jimmy implements low-level functional details. Since he has deep knowledge on how things work, he can reverse-engineer software and take special features of target devices into account.</skills>
  <intrinsic>Jimmy uses his standard design and development tools and processes to model and make sense of security issues.  Sometimes he finds thinking about security tedious, and will re-use settings and designs where he thinks this is appropriate.  This seems more efficient than thinking deeply about intricate details.

Although the different ways his software might be used can be overwhelming, thinking about them gets him thinking about what some of his target users might go through when setting up and running his applications.  At times, however, this appreciation can lead him to make decisions which err too much towards their freedom of action rather than the best decision given their implicit security and privacy expectations.</intrinsic>
  <contextual>Thinking about the many different contexts can be taxing, particularly given the tools available to Jimmy are not a perfect fit for this job.  Unfortunately, different contexts are not Jimmy's only worry.  The problems associated with things like categorising and structuring security information, and the discussions sometimes Jimmy has to have with colleagues, means making any sort of security design decision can forever.

These considerations mean that, in the cold light of day, Jimmy is forced to make decisions that might lead to inappropriate user behaviours.  This causes some angst when having to trade-off user freedom with what he considers an appropriate level of security when deciding default settings.</contextual>

<persona name="Peter" type="Primary" assumption_persona="TRUE" image="/home/cairisuser/cairis/cairis/images/peter.jpg" >
  <activities>Peter is an older gentleman, single and without many family commitments. He is fairly wealthy and enjoys spending his time and money on his interests: music, art and cars. He has a senior position at a large financial company, but when he is out of work he rarely thinks about his job.

Peter collects all the objects related to his interests - albums, paintings and cars - and would like to increase his access to them through new technology.</activities>
  <attitudes>Peter's well-paid job has allowed him to concentrate on the things that he loves: art, music and his main obsession: cars.

Peter likes using technology to further these interests. He spends considerable amounts of his leisure time driving, reading about cars and buying accessories and upgrades. He expects technology to help bridge the gap between his interests, so that he can enjoy art and music while on the move. Peter's lack of family commitments allows him to spend even more time on his hobbies. He relies on technology to let him organise and use his enormous music collection.</attitudes>
  <aptitudes>Peter is familiar with technology and no stranger to electronic media such as music and radio.

Peter is patient with technology and is willing to explore a new interface and follow pop-up instructions before he achieves his main objectives.</aptitudes>
  <motivations>Peter is primarily interest-driven. He wants to use technology to bring his interests to his daily commute as well as letting him enjoy art and music whenever he has a spare moment, or whenever he comes across something new that he likes.</motivations>

<persona name="Richard" type="Secondary" assumption_persona="TRUE" image="/home/cairisuser/cairis/cairis/images/richard.jpg" >
  <activities>Richard spends about half of his time at his desk; the other half is spent on duty in the community. He works and interacts with technology at set times, and is prescribed by the policies and tools employed by his station.
Although his working hours are pre-determined, the nature of shift work means he might work on different days, and different times of day. Being a policeman is a physically demanding, and the technology accompanying him can be "put through its paces". As a result, technology is prone to breakage or loss, and subsequent replacement.</activities>
  <attitudes>Like many security professionals, Richard is conservative by nature; he prefers the "tried and tested" over the novel and unknown. As a figure of authority, he embraces authority, and serving the community gives him a high sense of self-worth and assertiveness. However, working with the less desirable aspects of society has also made Richard cynical and suspicious of outsiders. Consequently, Richard can be quick to jump to conclusions, an attribute he chalks up to experience, but others may see as prejudicial.
Richard's pragmatism filters through to his attitude to technology: either it does the job or not; if it works he'll use it, if it doesn't he won't.</attitudes>
  <aptitudes>To effectively perform his duties, Richard needs to be emotionally stable, and approaching any problems with a calm and rationale manner. Some of these duties are less glamorous than others, so a low boredom threshold helps. Working with the public on a day-to-day basis also requires a certain affinity with people, intuitively empathising when required and asserting his authority when needed.</aptitudes>
  <motivations>Like any professional, Richard wants to do well at his job, to get noticed and get the next promotions. On a day-to-day basis this means being efficient and effective. The technology that supports him does not have to be perfect, the UI does not have to be sleek; Richard will put up with a lot of "irritations" as long at the technology does the job effectively.
Richard is burdened by the administration that plagues his working life. Anything that enables him to spend less time in the office and more time on the streets doing his job is a good thing.</motivations>
  <skills>Richard has acquired his skills through his training and professional development. The skills of organisation, memory and observation are base skills every policeman is grounded in and Richard has these in abundance. Richard tolerates routine, and understand and values the need for clear procedure in his daily habits.
Richard is a fast decision maker and can follow this through with the public and his work colleague, demonstrating leadership.</skills>

  <excerpt>For example, all values handled by the diabetes web application could continuously be stored in her diabetes file in the cloud and made available to her endocrinologist, her nurse, her dietitian, etc. \n\nAlternatively, Clara can make her results available when she visits her diabetes doctor for her three-monthly check-up. A scenario is that Clara takes out her mobile phone and starts her Webinos diabetes web application. She goes to the “Sharing my file” page. The application automatically searches for Webinos enabled devices in the vicinity. The doctor’s mobile phone shows up on the list and Webinos automatically provides Clara with the necessary data to check the security of sharing the file. Clara can then choose to share her file with the doctor using this mobile phone.</excerpt>

    <narrative>As the lifespan of people is growing, the number of people having at least one chronic disease is increasing. Personal medical sensors and mobile communication could play a big role for the treatment of chronically ill persons and also improve their quality of life. Furthermore, sensors and mobile communication makes remote monitoring possible, which is convenient for the patients and saves money for healthcare providers.

In the following story, Clara is a teenager with diabetes. She uses her favorite blood glucose meter to measure her blood glucose levels. This meter is also able to communicate with internet connected computing devices such as her laptop and her mobile smart phone through a standardized local communication method (USB, Bluetooth, BLE, ANT+ etc). 

Clara has found several interesting cloud-based web applications for diabetics. These applications help Clara analyzing her blood glucose levels so that she can control her disease. The applications could for example display all her glucose levels for a certain time period, display diagrams showing average values throughout a day, show statistics on glucose levels within target/below target/above target, etc. She runs these web applications not only on her laptop but also on her mobile smart phone as well as on the family's internet connected TV. When she runs the applications they discover that there is connectivity with her blood glucose meter and all values stored in the meter are transferred to the computing device and are processed by the diabetes web application. Clara's blood glucose meter can be used by any diabetes web application that fulfills any standardized manner to retrieve values from the blood glucose meter.

The most common case is that the blood glucose meter is connected to the computing device and values are transferred when Clara starts the diabetes web application. It is also possible to have a continuous connection so that each measured value is instantly sent to the computing device. This is especially applicable for future non-invasive (checking blood glucose levels without puncturing the skin for a blood sample) continuous blood glucose meters. For elderly and possibly demented diabetics who are not capable of understanding and acting on blood sugar values by themselves continuous blood sugar measurement with instant transmission to a wireless connected computing device and further direct uploading to a health care provider web service may be necessary.

A webinos enabled diabetes web application also has the possibility to store Clara's blood glucose values in a diabetes file in the cloud. It is important that this file is stored in a secure manner and that no unauthorized third parties have access to it. The file could be shared with her health care provider based on Clara's decision. For example, all values handled by the diabetes web application could continuously be stored in her diabetes file in the cloud and be made available to her endocrinologist, her nurse, her dietitian, etc. This would for example allow the doctor to spot persistent out-of-normal-range episodes early. The doctor and other medical parties could also update the diabetes file with information from the laboratory e.g. HBA1c (which reflects the average blood glucose level during the last 2 - 3 month period), provide recommendations on modifications to the diet or medication and remind Clara of important upcoming events such as the expiration of prescriptions.

Alternatively, Clara can make her results available when she visits her diabetes doctor for her three-monthly check-up. A scenario can be that Clara takes out her mobile phone and starts her webinos diabetes web application. She goes to the Sharing my file page. The application automatically searches for webinos enabled devices in the vicinity. The doctor's mobile phone shows up on the list and webinos automatically provides Clara with the necessary data to check the security of sharing the file. Clara can then choose to share her file with the doctor using this mobile phone. Now the doctor gets a notification on his mobile phone and his PC that Clara has shared her file with him and he can now check the results and update the file where applicable.

    <narrative>As the lifespan of people is growing, the number of people having at least one chronic disease is increasing. Personal medical sensors and mobile communication could play a big role for the treatment of chronically ill persons and also improve their quality of life. Furthermore, sensors and mobile communication makes remote monitoring possible, which is convenient for the patients and saves money for healthcare providers.

In the following story, Clara is a teenager with diabetes. She uses her favorite blood glucose meter to measure her blood glucose levels. This meter is also able to communicate with internet connected computing devices such as her laptop and her mobile smart phone through a standardized local communication method (USB, Bluetooth, BLE, ANT+ etc). 

Clara has found several interesting cloud-based web applications for diabetics. These applications help Clara analyzing her blood glucose levels so that she can control her disease. The applications could for example display all her glucose levels for a certain time period, display diagrams showing average values throughout a day, show statistics on glucose levels within target/below target/above target, etc. She runs these web applications not only on her laptop but also on her mobile smart phone as well as on the family's internet connected TV. When she runs the applications they discover that there is connectivity with her blood glucose meter and all values stored in the meter are transferred to the computing device and are processed by the diabetes web application. Clara's blood glucose meter can be used by any diabetes web application that fulfills any standardized manner to retrieve values from the blood glucose meter.

The most common case is that the blood glucose meter is connected to the computing device and values are transferred when Clara starts the diabetes web application. It is also possible to have a continuous connection so that each measured value is instantly sent to the computing device. This is especially applicable for future non-invasive (checking blood glucose levels without puncturing the skin for a blood sample) continuous blood glucose meters. For elderly and possibly demented diabetics who are not capable of understanding and acting on blood sugar values by themselves continuous blood sugar measurement with instant transmission to a wireless connected computing device and further direct uploading to a health care provider web service may be necessary.

    <narrative>Gloria has a webinos-compatible mobile phone and car, and owns several online identities; she is particular keen on keeping her work and personal life separate. When using her mobile phone for work she uses her LinkedIn identity, and during the weekends she moves to a Facebook-provided identity.  Outside work, she enjoys shopping and, on occasion, hearing about promotions and deals at her favorite shops.  For this reason, she has configured webinos to accept nearby requests from sensors and networks to inform her of relevant special offers.

Gloria visits a nearby restaurant, and is alerted on her phone that the restaurant can take any information about her allergies and tailor menus specifically for her.  After a few moments thought, Gloria thought this might be useful, so she agrees to share her allergy information. However, she also specifies that this information should not be shared with any other applications.  On her return home, Gloria gives more thought about how the restaurants was able to alert her about allergy-specific menus.  "Sometimes", Gloria thought, "I might want a little more privacy because I'm visiting somewhere more risqué or shopping for a surprise present."  As she nows feels a little uncomfortable about some of her private information becoming publicly available, she decides to edit her webinos privacy preferences.  In particular, she restricts the applications which might have access to her name, online identity, current location and device information.  These revised preferences won't keep track of what she is doing or where she is going, and will keep her devices hidden from nearby networks. She can switch to this policy very easily, and does so whenever she feels she would like greater “nonobservability”.

</narrative>
    <consequences>* People have many electronic identities which they would like to keep separate, but current systems are bad at providing this isolation.

* Users do want to share data and receive personalized services. However, they need the tools to control what services are allowed to do and what data they disclose.

* Policy and privacy decisions change over time. What was once unacceptable may change, or a new application feature might persuade someone to alter their policy decisions. However, existing applications often force the decision upfront and do not make it easy for these changes to happen.

* Privacy violations can affect the trust that users have in a system or infrastructure.

* The protection of user privacy will become more important in a world dominated by sensor networks. Governments have an obligation to protect citizens and EU policies have been forward thinking in this respect. Software infrastructures should provide the necessary tools to let users make sensible decisions about their privacy.

* Privacy policies change according to domain and should be context enabled. For example -- home, venue (e.g. the café), office, street and city have different (and in some cases overlapping) privacy frameworks. In addition, specific applications will have their own privacy policies, for example in smart grids and health care.

* Policy management, no matter how well designed, can be time consuming and difficult for even technically-­skilled end users.

</consequences>
    <benefits>* Users are given both fine-­-grained control as well as intuitive simple control to manage their privacy and visibility.

* webinos can scale to future technologies such as sensor networks, smart grid and healthcare scenarios by managing the changing privacy and security issues.

* Users can share data with trustworthy services and applications with more confidence when policies are enforced.

* webinos can enable advertisers to tailor adverts to the right customer and offer discounts on products they have a genuine interest in. This functionality is balanced against the need for users to maintain the confidentiality of their private information and not share too much about themselves.

    <narrative>A central London department store wants to attract more customers by launching a retail advertising campaign taking advantage of information about the customers' mobile device to provide a more targeted and relevant campaign to individual customers.  To do this, they have decided to launch the compaign which relies on ads placed within mobile web applications.  If prospective customers are near a Joe Lewis store and running an application with placed advertising then, based on their preferences, they will receive a special offer entitling them to a discount on certain products.  These product discounts will be tailored based on their webinos preferences.  Joe Lewis will run this campaign using a large developer platform whose APIs support webinos.  Support for webinos was important to Joe Lewis when selecting a platform upon which to base their advertising.  Because there is a growing emphasis on consumer privacy, Joe Lewis has made the decision to only use marketing tools that conform to EU data protection regulations; they understand that their selected platform partner conforms to these regulations due to their platform APIs rely on webinos for eliciting privacy sensitive information..

Three weeks later, Peter and Gloria are walking past this store on opposite sides of the shop, and in opposite directions.  Peter, who is visiting London for the weekend, receives an alert from his diary app about a special offer on sound-proof headphones, which is fortuitous as he was thinking about buying a set of these only the other day.  Meanwhile, Gloria receives no messages at all because, although the platform deduced that some dietary preferences had been defined for Gloria, her policy was such that she had explicitiy asked this information not to be disclosed.

    <narrative>Alice is sitting in front of her Internet enabled TV and is browsing the web. She install a new application which allow access to a community of eighty's romantic movie fans (providing clips and lots of information about them) which was recommended by Bob, a friend of Alice. As usual, there is some profile information that must be provided to complete the registration procedure and become a member of the community.

Because webinos has build in user identity features, the application can retrieve most of the needed information to pre-fill required data. From the PZP, the application may retrieve first name, surname, address, preferred nick name, etc. Additionally, the application credentials can be stored in the Alice personal zone, and provided to the application when required. Thus, if webinos is running there is no need for manual logins later.

The webinos identity mechanism provided most of the needed information but there are still some fields left which should be filled out by Alice. Additionally, Alice may want to change some pre-­-filled values which should be unique to the application or at least different to the proposed values.

Alice decides to change and add some values. Due to common remote control restrictions, such as the absence of easy to use text input facilities on the TV, this is not an easy and comfortable task if a TV remote control is used. Completing profile information could be time consuming tasks.

With webinos each webinos-enabled device that provides text input capabilities could be used to insert text for an application running on a TV set in a user friendly manner. Alice has several text input sources in her environment. A common desktop computer with an attached keyboard, a smart phone, and a tablet. Thanks to the "webinos-enabled keyboard" application running on each of those devices, all of them can be used as input media for another device in the personal zone. In this way, there is no need for yet another keyboard for yet another screen; each keyboard can be used for each screen. Or, even better, only one keyboard is needed to control all the devices.

The social community application needs some information from Alice and therefore the application presents alternative input methods. Alice decides to use her tablet instead of the TV’s primary input source (the remote control). Additionally she selects to use her tablet also in the future without asking.

To complete the registration Alice wants to attach a current picture of hers to her profile. The social community app can query the available photos of Alice in the personal zone, but no one of them seems appropriate to Alice. She wants to make a new photo right now. The social app retrieves a list of usable cameras, and due to a policy, all but the smart phone one are filtered out since are not in close proximity to Alice, which selects her smart phone device, anyway equipped with a pretty good camera. She also decides to use her smart phone any time in the future if a camera is requested by the application. After the picture was taken is attached to the profile and the registration is complete.

Because Bob proposed to join the community, Alice wants to get in contact with Bob who is currently also online in the community. Alice initializes a video chat with him to tell him that she is now also a member. She clicks on “video chat with Bob” and this time Alice is asked to use her smart phone which also notifies access to the camera. After the connections are established both videos streams, Bob’s and Alice’s, are shown in real time on the TV.

While both are talking together Bob receives a message from another friend of both whose name is Charlie. Charlie is currently on the way sitting on the backseat while his father is driving. The application allows multi user video chats while all chat participants are shown in case that the application is shown on the TV screen, but will only show the current speaker if shown on small screens.

Bob invites Charlie to join the video chat and to talk about what to do next weekend. Charlie’s connection does not allow for video streaming, due to limited in-car's bandwidth but instead allow for an audio-only one. The application can adapt to the local availablity, and by default choose the audio-only option when it runs in bandwidth -constrained devices.

The social community app offers upcoming events which are collected from different external sources and presented to the user. The three friends are clicking a while through the events and later they decide to watch a movie that is currently running in cinemas. Bob clicks on “participate on event” and selects all video chat participants as attendees. With this click the event is added to Alice’s, Bob’s, as well as Charlie’s mobile phone calendars.

</narrative>
    <consequences>The issues addressed by the story are directly related to the “one virtual device” idea of webinos. Each hardware or software based service of any device could be used by any of the other devices. For example using a mobile phone’s camera to take a picture and directly present it on the TV screen without any direct user interaction for the transfer of the data. In general, Alice wants to use any feature or service of any of her devices in a common integrated way realized by webinos applications, here the TV as primary application execution environment, to not rely on multiple devices with the same functionality for each device that executes applications.

    <narrative>This story is described from the perspective of an application developer who is writing and supporting a webinos application with privacy and security concerns that require policy management.

Jimmy is developing a webinos application to support the social network site Twitter, and wants to develop a user interface than the website, including bigger input fields, location-­-based services and offline features such as local storage of tweets.  Jimmy starts looking at the webinos API and, while the UI development seems straightforward, location-based function involve making an access-control request to the underlying system, and handing access denied requests.  Jimmy designs his application to handle these access denied responses gracefully.

After developing an initial tablet-based prototype with resources he has access to, and making note of what resources his application needs, he checks his application against a set of sample end-user privacy policies.  These samples are representative of real policies and, by developing with these in mind, Jimmy can predict when calls might require approval by end-users.  In two cases, Jimmy notices that privacy policies request more detail about why access to a piece of personal information – stored in the user’s profile – has been requested by his application.  He decides to modify the application such that the user’s date of birth is not collected, and a better rationale is provided for why location data is needed.

Before installing the updated prototype to an Android handset, Jimmy tweaks the installation settings for the reasons that the application needs, and the reasons why they are needed.  During the installation itself, the installer provides an explanation for the resources that need access, and whether or not this conflicts with the end-user privacy policy that Jimmy is currently working with.  After installing the app, Jimmy tests that the application still continues to provide what he considers a satisfactory user experience.

As the application design becomes more apparent, Jimmy decides to use webinos' analytics feature to find out more about the services used by the customer, and where they live.  After experimenting with the webinos context module, the policies that control it, integration with other analytics APIs, and the impact that privacy policies might have on all of this, Jimmy decides that collecting analytical information is easier said than done.  Consequently, he decides to think more carefully about what data he needs to collect, and how to collect this would impacting runtime performance or the expectations of his end-users.

</narrative>
    <consequences>* Recent web services have a record of encroaching on the privacy expectations of customers. This can affect the trust that users have in a system or an infrastructure.

* Developers are not always given the tools to work with user privacy requirements, and end up making applications which require access to as much data as possible, purely to simplify the development process.

* Users have their own opinions of what data usage is acceptable. Applications currently dictate the terms in which they are used rather than negotiating data disclosure versus functionality offered.

* Application developers want their program to be used, and want to take advantage of device features. However, they also do not want to scare potential users, and therefore need to request only the capabilities that their applications need to have access to. Should these still be unacceptable, it is better to provide limited access than none at all. This will encourage users to be more adventurous and adopt new applications.

</consequences>
    <benefits>* All access to private user data is mediated and may be controlled by the user.

* Companies developing applications can do so against known security and privacy policies, so they can improve the user experience and avoid endless pop-­-ups and requests for access permissions.

* Developers are encouraged to design applications to make use of as little personal data as possible.

    <narrative>Peter is considering buying a new car of the BMW 3-­-series. He likes the style of it and especially that he can travel to Munich to personalize for his individual interior choice, exterior, but also for infotainment, engine, tires, and safety choices.

Justin accepts to go to the BMW museum with Peter, since interested in cars, music and fashion.

When Peter arrives to the Museum, at the reception desk He may get a museum guide for mobile with free connection to the wireless network. He accepts and installs the application.

The museum guide allows to be shared on different devices and users, and Justin happily ask to share it while in the museum.

Through the guide, Peter discovers that he can literally hold the phone close to each artifact, and relevant information is automatically presented on his mobile. Meanwhile Justin discover the possibility to also view videos describing the history of some BMW series.

Those videos comes with extra audio and subtitle streams for different languages. The videos has also a special stream for hearing impaired users where the environmental noise is reduced in order to make the actors speech clearer.

It is a huge advantage for the friends that the movie has these different audio streams. Justin is not as good as Peter in understanding German and prefers video in the English language anyway. 

</narrative>
    <consequences>For some users it is uncomfortable to consume the same content together. Especially language or physical restrictions can influence the experience. One issue here is to provide the content in an appropriate format while using an appropriate device to the user’s private device in order to improve the user’s content consumption experience.

The scenario requires that the devices involved have wireless, contactless, and camera capabilities. It also requires from the converged webinos applications that data can be instantly and seamlessly transferred between the devices and applications through open standard interfaces. Applications can additionally run in parallel. Applications and data can also be added automatically to the cloud in the background while applications are being used.

</consequences>
    <benefits>An easy integration of private “output streams” (which could be audio, video, or text maybe even with real-time translation) allows for an improved social life style. webinos allows to deliver content in a format that can be handled by the user’s device.

Providing converged applications enables application developers to incrementally roll out applications as an evolving package consisting of several smaller applications. These can be glued and interlinked together with each other. They can start/pause/resume/stop each other from within the application. Additionally the applications can run in parallel. Devices instantly connect to each other to enhance aspects of the information experience for the end users. The story also involves the use of contactless and wireless transfer of data between devices, and in addition to this, the use of the camera on the mobile to obtain object recognition and visual search for information

    <narrative>Jimmy loves to develop programs. He has created several good-­selling apps for the iPhone. Also, his blog is well visited and he makes quite some cash with the corresponding add income. His expertise is creating well working mobile apps in the category of ‘life hacking’.

He has heard of webinos and decides to take it for a spin. Luckily, it is open source as he is getting more and more frustrated with the closeness of the iStore. Better still, after download he can do a local install. After only 15 minutes he is running his own development webinos cloud.

He soon gets himself familiarized with the webinos concept and APIs and ports his latest iPhone app ZenSearch to webinos. That application searches the web for photos (in the public domain or with a certain CC licence) which are usable in Zen-­style presentations. It consists of a back-end and a front-­end. The back-­-end is a server that does the searching and ‘scoring’ of the photos. The front-­end is the aforementioned iPhone app with its excellent navigational interface. For the porting effort the server, of course, is fine as it is. The mobile app however needs to be rewritten to HTML + CSS + JavaScript. This is okay, because the website of the ZenSearch service and the mobile app will have more in common and are thus easier maintainable. Finally, because webinos bridges to the DLNA home network, his app cannot only suggest beautiful pictures but also show them on the End Users’ TV. All that for just a couple of JavaScript lines!

</narrative>
    <consequences>* Jimmy wants to learn new technology but is often overwhelmed before he begins. For example a simple experiment with a scripting language once required him to do a make and install with system administrator rights.

* Jimmy learns quickly. However, new paradigms he often finds hard to comprehend. (His favorite learning style is just to start experimenting.)

* As a professional and agile developer Jimmy likes his development, test and deployment environments clearly separated while highly manageable.

* Jimmy would very much like to create apps that use the television, but he is too unfamiliar with UPnP, DLNA and what else.

* Being forced in a single direction usually puts off Jimmy. He has an allergy for notions like ‘the one platform that rules them all’ or ‘the mother of all platforms’. He likes to be able to make his own choice which abstraction level to design his applications on.

* Jimmy likes to control his own stuff. His NAS is securely reachable from the internet using public/private keys and he runs his own mail server for all his domains.

</consequences>
    <benefits>* webinos provides a smooth installation experiencing, running out of the box on all supported platforms. (When a new technology advertises ease of use it should behave like that itself, even during installation.)

* webinos provides a great learning experience that caters for all learning styles. Developers that take it for a test drive are in no way hindered to choose for webinos.

* Having formal and separated environments for development, test and deployment is considered to be good practice.

* Having full access to webinos functionality using HTML + CSS + JavaScript makes the target developer audience as large as possible.

* Being able to access webinos functionality using native APIs attracts the more advanced developers which can in turn create more advanced solutions.

* Integrating with other devices, especially if they use lesser known protocols like UPnP requires a lot of work. Having webinos do the bridging to its familiar environment both scales up webinos functionality quickly and makes it easier for developers to create compelling apps.

* Allowing federation between (i.e. seamless interworking of independent instances of) different webinos clouds maximizes the number of people that will actually use it in their daily life.

Carlos has seen many proposed solution, but these remain on paper alone.  Carlos also sees that many of the new privacy initiatives that the EU wants to implement, especially for sensor based networks, may be implemented after deployment. For Carlos, that means potentially never. This is a concern and on behalf of the Commission, he sets about finding a solution before sensors become commonly deployed (with privacy becoming an afterthought).

Carlos has heard about webinos following a discussion with one of his colleagues. He likes the sounds of webinos because it is open source and web based, and thus potentially available to everyone.  Because of its cross-device scope, he thinks webinos might form part of a privacy solution across current and future platforms.  At an EU sponsored workshop on privacy and design, Carlos explains his vision to a mixed audience from academia and industry.  He wants to work collaboratively with vendors to implement privacy policies that empower and protect EU citizens, and make webinos one of the mechanisms for a central, secure profile controlled by users, which is agnostic of any technology and can be accessed across all platforms. webinos will also be used to provide a client side dashboard (e.g. on a phone) on multiple platforms that accesses the privacy profile and uses it to enable or disable services.  The dashboard will build upon previous work on EU projects, such as PrimeLife, while also being compatible with accessibility tools and technologies being developed by related projects such as Cloud4All . The systems developed by the commission will enhance the privacy profile in such a way that the latest privacy regulation guidelines are encoded in the profiles and are accessible through the dashboard.

But his webinos-enabled laptop is switched off, and his webinos-enabled TV (at home) has been instructed to not synchronize data when Georg left his house, to save unnecessary bandwidth consumption. Anyway, the smart-phone dictionary is ready and up-to-date.

So, Georg can pilot the navigation system of the car accurately, and instructs it to posts to Georg’s Twitter account “George is on the way to the Alps, be there in 4 hours” while safely driven, and edit/complete that default phrase with "he's ready for a beautiful week-end"

    <narrative>It was 2315 and, after a night at the opera with some friends in Frankfurt, Peter was on the tram back to his apartment.  Peter was about to doze off when was stirred by the sound of shouting outside.  The tram had stopped for a few minutes at Luisenplatz; this is fairly common given it's position as an interchange for several tram and bus routes.  Peter looked out of the window towards the square and the source of the disturbance.  An intimidating group of youths with a strong penchant for black clothing and Alsatians was sat at the foot of the statue of Ludo.  Based on the slurring of their speech, their excessive volume, and the several half-empty crates of Schneider-Weisse, it is clear to Peter that everyone in the group was quite drunk.

As he surveyed the scene, a large, shaven-head member of the group stumbled over to the Ludwigsmonument with a spray-paint can.  As the sounds of an impromptu rendition of "Feuer Frei" rang out over Luisenplatz, the youth began spray painting graffiti onto the base of the statue.  While Peter found this wanton act reprehensible, other passers-by in the square were acquiescent.  With no police nearby, no-one wanted to challenge the behaviour of a large, clearly inebriated group of youths with dogs.

Peter quickly entered "vandal graffiti" into the text field  beside the photo, assigned the event to a "Graffiti" category, and clicked on the Send button.  Meanwhile, the youth had returned to the group, who had now determined that the flash came from Peter's tram.  As the group advanced menacingly towards the tram, a bell sounded and the tram slowly pulled away.  Relieved, Peter returned the phone to his pocket, and hoped that his action had made a difference.

Although she has lots of friends that wouldn't mind lending her their notes, she prefers to be independent from others. However, the last time she tried to ignore her condition she ended up in hospital for three days. So she decides to get back in bed and use her laptop to access the university's online learning platform instead. It is an old laptop, but it has a custom-made keyboard with extra-large buttons to improve accessibility.

The university recently extended its learning environment to support webinos-enabled devices. As she browses through the available course material, she can't help wondering what all the webinos fuss is about, because she doesn't notice any changes. However, after selecting today's presentation she gets an unexpected notification. It states that nearby devices have been found which are better suited to render the requested content. Surprised, though intrigued, Anna accepts the suggestion to access the presentation from an alternative device. Within a blink of a second, her television set is automatically woken from it energy-saving mode and a few moments later the first slide is showing up on its screen. "Great", she thinks, "how do I navigate this thing?". Because of her limited motor skills, especially at this time of the morning, she isn't too keen on using the television's remote control.

On his way to work one morning, Helen browses the app store and discovers a webinos app that allows him to keep all of her diaries in sync automatically. Helen assumes this might simply be a cloud-based scheduler, but because she is on the train and doesn't have a huge amount of time before his train pulls in, she decides to download and setup this app on her tablet now as it appears to be quite small.

Helen started up the app for the first time, expecting to have to install existing data from his phone's calendar. She wasn't disappointed, but first Helen was asked to walkthrough several webinos dialogues asking him to set up things called "personal devices" and "personal zones". Helen didn't know anything about what these were so, because he was on the go, he clicked through every dialog until the application started up.

After lunch that day, Helen was suddenly reminded about his meet-up that day and her need to check the time. As she was about to reach for her jacket and her phone to check his diary, she remember the new diary app she installed. She decided to give this new app a go by checking her diary using her tablet.

    <narrative>Jimmy is an ambitioned professional software developer who is always interested in new technologies. Thus he also tries webinos. As he likes interconnected devices, he is fond of webinos’ inter-device communication capabilities. He ports one of his applications (called ZenSearch) for webinos. This application is both a client frontend for the search service on the Internet and a media push service for the TV. The user uses ZenSearch for finding nice royalty-free pictures on the Internet. These pictures are transferred to the client and then pushed to the TV to display them there in full screen mode.

Jimmy is a practitioner. He rather starts experimenting and he learns from examples instead of reading the documentation and understanding the philosophy behind it. As a consequence, he is not familiar with the architecture and the security concept of webinos, as well as the security guidelines provided by the project.

Jimmy makes an ill assumption about webinos’ architecture and unintentionally makes an architectural decision for his application which opens an attack vector. He assumes that input validation is not necessary in his application. Actually, by porting his existing client application to webinos, he does not pay enough attention to architectural changes which are needed. He just quickly decides that the TV does not expose a critical API which could result in serious damage when being misused. Thus he does not spend enough thoughts on security and he does not notice that input validation is required. Consequently, he introduces a cross-site scripting vulnerability (XSS) in the ZenSearch client application. It allows an attacker, who can manipulate the content of a Web site which is found by the search service, to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the ZenSearch client’s device.

The attack works as follows. The search service presents search results of Web sites which contain the pictures. Each of these Web sites may contain JavaScript code. The search service has a XSS vulnerability where the URLs of found Web sites are not sanitised properly. A specially crafted URL which contains JavaScript code is forwarded to the ZenSearch client without any filtering. An attacker prepares a Web site with thousands of royalty-free pictures to provide these specially crafted URLs. Due to Jimmy’s decision, the ZenSearch client application also does not validate the URLs and the content of the Web sites which are received by the application upon search request. If the search results contain JavaScript, the code is executed by the ZenSearch client application. Webinos transparently establishes a communication channel with other devices when a remote API is accessed. Depending on the security policy under which the ZenSearch client application is executed, an attacker can cause more or less serious damage by calling various remote APIs. One example of such damage is that the user clickes a link on the search results with injected JavaScript code. This code calls the Contacts API of another device which belongs to the same personal zone. This device is found by using webinos' Discovery API. It then accesses the contacts on that device and sends them all out to the attacker’s email address without the consent of the user.

Jimmy’s mistake was to assume that his ZenSearch client application cannot be a risk for the user, as it only pushes the pictures to the TV without obtaining any data from the TV. As a consequence, Jimmy thought, an attacker cannot reveal or manipulate any user data. He has overlooked that the injected code of the attacker can also establish a communication channel to another device in the personal zone of the user.</narrative>
    <consequences>* The attacker can remote control the webinos-enabled device and execute arbitrary JavaScript code. This opens an avenue for manifold severe attacks.
* Using the application is a risk for the user even though the application itself is harmless.</consequences>

Jimmy’s mistake was to assume that his ZenSearch client application cannot be a risk for the user, as it only pushes the pictures to the TV without obtaining any data from the TV. As a consequence, Jimmy thought, an attacker cannot reveal or manipulate any user data. He has overlooked that the injected code of the attacker can also establish a communication channel to another device in the personal zone of the user.</narrative>
    <consequences>* The attacker can remote control the webinos-enabled device and execute arbitrary JavaScript code. This opens an avenue for manifold severe attacks.
* Using the application is a risk for the user even though the application itself is harmless.</consequences>

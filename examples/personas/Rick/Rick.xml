 <activities>Rick is a clean-water plant operator, responsible for ensuring that water processed through the plant is in line with specified set-points.  Rick's area of responsibility extend outside of the confines of the plant to include checking on pumping stations, which feed water into the plant's nearby reservoir.

During his working shifts (he works a 5 + 1 continental shift), Rick frequently checks readings on his SCADA workstation, takes water samples at various locations around the plant, and responds to alarms raised by the SCADA system; if necessary this involves investigating problems, and -- if no remedial tasks are possible -- calling someone out to investigate further.

At the start of every shift, Rick checks AJS to see what work he is scheduled to carry out.  He usually updates AJS based on the work he carried out before the end of his shift.  Rick also maintains a paper work diary, which is updated after carrying out specific work or responding to problems.  This, together with the status white board, is also useful for explaining any on-going issues when handing over to the next shift.  </activities>
  <attitudes>Rick isn't particularly concerned about people trying to hack into the SCADA system he uses.  "The only way the SCADA will get infected", Rick says, "is by an instrument tech plugging a virus infected laptop into it".

Rick is aware of Information Security communiques on InfoPortal, but doesn't see how this is relevant to him.  "We don't have laptops", says Rick, "and we don't leave site, so we don't leave anything in cars".  Rick is, however, aware of Information Security controls.  Rick knows that logout policies keep intruders from getting access to his workstation (although he thinks the logout period is too short given his environment), and he knows he can only access certain pumping sites via the telemetry system.

Although Rick can call an instrument tech for many problems, experience has taught him not to expect much from the ACME ICT support during a night shift.  "What's the point of calling up to say you can't login at night if all you get is a reference number", Rick complains, "that won't help me start my pumps now!"  Although Rick knows he can call out an instrument tech to help, he is also conscious that they are out most evenings, and might not appreciate a call-out for a corporate ICT problem.</attitudes>
  <aptitudes>Rick has been a plant operator for over 10 years.  Although the exact procedures need to run his plant are documented in a works manual, he doesn't need to refer to it.  "I haven't read the works manual in years", Rick says.

This experience does not stay in Rick's head. When problems have occurred, he raises these during team meetings, and any lessons learned sometimes find their way into the SCADA system as new functionality.  Rick is aware of the new EnterpriseSCADA developments and possible improvements to the HMI and start-up procedure.  Although not fully in the loop about what is going on, he hopes that, like the current system, there will be productivity improvements without an adverse impact.

Rick uses the SCADA's trend monitoring facilities as a indication of possible problems.  "If the trends freeze or flat-line", Rick says, "I need to go out and take a look at what's wrong".  Because problems occur daily, and he is often on his own, Rick can still control the plant using panel PCs at remote locations around the plant.</aptitudes>
  <motivations>Because the water quality can change over a matter of minutes, Rick's ethos is that you need to be ready for anything.  Because of this, checking certain parameters and pieces of kit is an important discipline, as is logging important events in the works diary and on the status board; these aid communication to other shift members, and the eventual piecing together of the elements of an event.

Although information security doesn't phase Rick too much, personal security does.  Potentially facing off a scrap metal thief is a big worry for Rick. "The police don't respond to intruder alarms at a nearby pumping station any more due to false alarms", says Rick.  "Because of this, we've been told not to go out to these places on our own.   We have a lone-worker system when people call us when we get to a particular station, but what happens if we get problems on the way?"</motivations>
  <skills>Rick has a basic operating knowledge of Windows; enough to carry out his day-to-day routines, check his email, and navigate the main sections of InfoPortal.

Rick isn't a power-user; he acknowledges that younger "whizz kids" are much more adept at using PCs than he is.  Consequently, he only uses a sub-set of the desktop icons currently on his desktop.  "I don't know what these other applications do", Rick says,"I've tried clicking on one and it just gives me a Data Protection Warning.  I guess this means I'm not authorised to use it."</skills>

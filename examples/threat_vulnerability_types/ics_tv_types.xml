<threat_type name="Insider/Manipulation">
  <description>Sometimes deliberate attempts are made to acquire information or access by manipulating staff by using a range of influencing techniques.  This is sometimes described as social engineering, creating situations in which someone will willingly provide access to information, sites or systems to someone unauthorised to receive it.  Customer facing personnel who have been trained to be helpful and informative can be particularly vulnerable to such attacks.</description>

<threat_type name="Insider/Sabotage">
  <description>Saborage is often committed by a former employee seeking revenge on their employer because of a personal grudge caused by a negative work related event such as dismissal.  Although it is sometimes planned well in advance, it can also be the result of an opportunistic moment.</description>

<threat_type name="Electronic/Malware">

<threat_type name="Electronic/Hacking">
  <description>Hackers want to get into your computer system and use them for their own purposes.  There are many hacking tools available on the internet as well as online communities actively discussing hacking techniques enabling even unskilled hackers to break into unprotected systems.  Hackers have a range of motives; from showing off their technical prowess, to theft of money, credentials or information, to cause damage.</description>
</threat_type>
<threat_type name="Electronic/DoS and DDoS">
  <description>A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack involves a malicious attempt to disrupt the operation of a computer system or network that is connected to the Internet.  A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is a more dangerous evolution of a DoS attack because it utilises a network of compromised zombie computers to mount the attack, so there is no identifiable single source.</description>
</threat_type>
<threat_type name="Electronic/Keystroke logging">
  <description>Keystroke loggers work by recording the sequence of key-strokes that a user types in.  The more sophisticated versions use filtering mechanisms to only record highly prized information such as email addresses, passwords and credit card number sequences.</description>
</threat_type>
<threat_type name="Electronic/Phishing and Spoofing">
  <description>Phishing describes a social engineering process designed to trick an organisation\'s customers into imparting confidential information such as passwords, personal data or banking and financial details.  Most commonly these are criminal attacks but the same techniques could be used by others to get sensitive information.</description>

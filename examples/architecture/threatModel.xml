<vulnerability_type name="API Abuse">
  <description>An API is a contract between a caller and a callee. The most common forms of API abuse are caused by the caller failing to honor its end of this contract. For example, if a program fails to call chdir() after calling chroot(), it violates the contract that specifies how to change the active root directory in a secure fashion. Another good example of library abuse is expecting the callee to return trustworthy DNS information to the caller. In this case, the caller abuses the callee API by making certain assumptions about its behavior (that the return value can be used for authentication purposes). One can also violate the caller-callee contract from the other side. For example, if a coder subclasses SecureRandom and returns a non-random value, the contract is violated.</description>

<vulnerability_type name="Sensitive Data Protection Vulnerability">
  <description>This category is for tagging vulnerabilities that lead to insecure protection of sensitive data. The protection referred here includes confidentiality and integrity of data during its whole lifecycles, including storage and transmission.\n\nPlease note that this category is intended to be different from access control problems, although they both fail to protect data appropriately. Normally, the goal of access control is to grant data access to some users but not others. In this category, we are instead concerned about protection for sensitive data that are not intended to be revealed to or modified by any application users. Examples of this kind of sensitive data can be cryptographic keys, passwords, security tokens or any information that an application relies on for critical decisions.\n\nExamples of this vulnerability can be:\n\n    * Information leakage results from insufficient memory clean-up\n    * Inappropriate protection of cryptographic keys (This should also be labeled with Category:Cryptography)\n    * Clear-text Passwords in configration files (This should also labeled with Category:Authentication if the passwords are used for authentication.)\n    * Lack of integrity protection for stored user data</description>

<persona name="Ethan" type="Primary" assumption_persona="TRUE" image="/home/irisuser/webinos/wp2/personas/ethan.png" >
  <activities>Ethan is a student just like many others: he has no particular problems or outstanding successes. Unlike many others, he believes that taking some shortcuts (of dubious legality) can be of some help. In order to gain some extra spending-money and fill his always-empty student pockets, he devotes part of his time to earning money illegally as a spammer. One of his activities, for example, is sending messages on behalf of individuals who sell counterfeit good, or participating in an email campaign for a "pump and dump" scheme.</activities>
  <attitudes>Much like many other students, Ethan does not have a strong inclination toward rules and laws. In fact, he has a quite pronounced inclination toward illicit activities that can be more or less remunerative. However, he still doesn't want to get in trouble with the law, he is just willing to risk it because he wants money even more.</attitudes>
  <aptitudes>Ethan has cultivated some of the essential skills for his fraudulent network activities. His habitual tasks consist in looking for vulnerable networks, exploiting such vulnerabilities and then gathering data from those non security-savvy systems. Whenever possible and whenever he thinks it is not too risky, he enjoys accessing and taking control of vulnerable systems and harvesting data from vulnerable targets. When successful, this often includes usernames, passwords, and also details of credit cards that have been illicitly gained by other malicious intruders. This information can be profitably used for trading of credit card number (good offers for them in Black Market) and for circumvent monitoring system and anti-spam filters.</aptitudes>
  <motivations>He wants easy money, since in his opinion it is very rarely the most tiresome way that is the best one. During his student career, he has found it difficult to make much money in legal ways. Since he already has a botnet at his service, why not use it for some additional source of wealth? Being a botnet administrator has many other benefits. For example, he can attack politicians with whom he disagrees. After all, Ethan has some sense of civic responsibility in his own way.</motivations>
  <skills>Ethan most important skills lies in the administrator-level knowledge of a botnet, and on the knowledge of how exploit it for illicit spamming activities and other illicit activities using them. For these reasons, knowledge of using spamming tools is of benefit to his business.</skills>

    <narrative>Ethan does not want a blemish on his CV. He knows enough on the security postures of his targets to be reasonably safe from problems. Up to now, he has never been identified has an illegal spammer, and he's very willingly to sustain his perfect record and appearance of honesty.</narrative>

<persona name="Jimmy" type="Primary" assumption_persona="TRUE" image="/home/irisuser/webinos/wp2/personas/jimmy.jpg" >
  <activities>Jimmy's life is software development and Internet services. He is a self-employed professional software developer for mobile applications but he also spends his leisure time on writing plug-ins for his home equipment.

Jimmy is a passionate and experienced professional software developer. His focus is on mobile applications and Web applications. His experience covers the iPhone, Android and further technologies. He writes new applications and ports them to different platforms. He does software development for quite some years. Apart from that, he is a passionate and successful blogger.</activities>
  <attitudes>When developing software, Jimmy prefers open source. For him it is important to control what is going on in the software he uses. He chooses his tool chain and makes architectural decisions for his software accordingly. He keeps all the source code he once wrote and reuses fragments of it in other projects whenever it makes sense. For him, his source code is his own treasury of valuables he has created in his life. He always wants to have access to it and reuse whenever useful. He has no notion of braking the law by this behaviour. He just wants to implement good and working applications without reimplementing things he already implemented.</attitudes>
  <aptitudes>Jimmy follows a pragmatic hands-on design and implementation approach. He is much more into trying out things rather than spending time on theory. As he is interested in new technologies and new market opportunities he always stays up-to-date in his field. Jimmy enjoys experimenting with new technology and he adapts quickly. He learns best by just trying out things. Apart from that, he knows how to make money from the applications he writes, as he sells some mobile applications on an application store.</aptitudes>
  <motivations>Jimmy is font of software-controlled gadgets which interact with other devices on his home network. He makes use of his professional knowledge to implement plug-ins and extensions for his home equipment. This allows him to let all the devices do what he needs.</motivations>
  <skills>Jimmy implements low-level functional details. Since he has deep knowledge on how things work, he can reverse-engineer software and take special features of target devices into account.</skills>

    <narrative>Jimmy is experienced in software security to some extent. He configures his home equipment to be accessible from the Internet, but it is protected by access control. On the other hand, he does not like to be limited by access control while using his computer and while implementing software.</narrative>

    <narrative>Jimmy loves to develop programs. He has created several good-­selling apps for the iPhone. Also, his blog is well visited and he makes quite some cash with the corresponding add income. His expertise is creating well working mobile apps in the category of ‘life hacking’.

He has heard of webinos and decides to take it for a spin. Luckily, it is open source as he is getting more and more frustrated with the closeness of the iStore. Better still, after download he can do a local install. After only 15 minutes he is running his own development webinos cloud.

He soon gets himself familiarized with the webinos concept and APIs and ports his latest iPhone app ZenSearch to webinos. That application searches the web for photos (in the public domain or with a certain CC licence) which are usable in Zen-­style presentations. It consists of a back-end and a front-­end. The back-­-end is a server that does the searching and ‘scoring’ of the photos. The front-­end is the aforementioned iPhone app with its excellent navigational interface. For the porting effort the server, of course, is fine as it is. The mobile app however needs to be rewritten to HTML + CSS + JavaScript. This is okay, because the website of the ZenSearch service and the mobile app will have more in common and are thus easier maintainable. Finally, because webinos bridges to the DLNA home network, his app cannot only suggest beautiful pictures but also show them on the End Users’ TV. All that for just a couple of JavaScript lines!

</narrative>
    <consequences>* Jimmy wants to learn new technology but is often overwhelmed before he begins. For example a simple experiment with a scripting language once required him to do a make and install with system administrator rights.

* Jimmy learns quickly. However, new paradigms he often finds hard to comprehend. (His favorite learning style is just to start experimenting.)

* As a professional and agile developer Jimmy likes his development, test and deployment environments clearly separated while highly manageable.

* Jimmy would very much like to create apps that use the television, but he is too unfamiliar with UPnP, DLNA and what else.

* Being forced in a single direction usually puts off Jimmy. He has an allergy for notions like ‘the one platform that rules them all’ or ‘the mother of all platforms’. He likes to be able to make his own choice which abstraction level to design his applications on.

* Jimmy likes to control his own stuff. His NAS is securely reachable from the internet using public/private keys and he runs his own mail server for all his domains.

</consequences>
    <benefits>* webinos provides a smooth installation experiencing, running out of the box on all supported platforms. (When a new technology advertises ease of use it should behave like that itself, even during installation.)

* webinos provides a great learning experience that caters for all learning styles. Developers that take it for a test drive are in no way hindered to choose for webinos.

* Having formal and separated environments for development, test and deployment is considered to be good practice.

* Having full access to webinos functionality using HTML + CSS + JavaScript makes the target developer audience as large as possible.

* Being able to access webinos functionality using native APIs attracts the more advanced developers which can in turn create more advanced solutions.

* Integrating with other devices, especially if they use lesser known protocols like UPnP requires a lot of work. Having webinos do the bridging to its familiar environment both scales up webinos functionality quickly and makes it easier for developers to create compelling apps.

* Allowing federation between (i.e. seamless interworking of independent instances of) different webinos clouds maximizes the number of people that will actually use it in their daily life.
